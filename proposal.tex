\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Problem Description}
With Internet technologies that are common in today’s society, social media platforms have become a widely-used communication medium. Included in this communication is information regarding natural disasters as they unfold. However, these data are often too large or noisy for real-time analysis by humans. Previous works have produced methods of filtering out content relevant to emergencies and detecting emergencies \cite{Avvenuti}. Other works have proposed methods breaking down large events into smaller subevents associated geographic information in some cases \cite{Pohl,Khurdiya,Hua}. 

This work will seek to evaluate and compare selected supervised learning algorithms for predicting the prioritization of subevents detected from social media sources by emergency responders. Since this research will depend on external sources for event and subevent detection, the social media platforms for analysis cannot be predetermined. The platforms will be limited to those for which event and subevent detection is available. The types of disasters for analysis have not been determined and will be limited by the properties of the event and subevent detection that is used.


\section{Research Objectives}
The primary goal of this study is to determine the viability of selected supervised learning algorithms for predicting the priority of subevents during a disaster event. Additionally, this study seeks to identify statistically significant differences in the performance of various selected algorithms. New algorithms will not be designed. Instead, known algorithms that have already been designed are used.
\subsection{Event and Subevent Detection}
In order to prioritize subevents, a set of subevents first needs to be identified. An event, identified by time and location, serves as the context for subevents \cite{Pohl}, thus events must be detected before any subevents can be identified. The objective of this portion of the project is to locate a source of subevent data. The source should obtain its data from subevent detection techniques from previous research.
\subsection{Disaster Dataset Procurement}
From the data source identified in the previous portion of the project, a sample of detected subevents will be selected in this in this phase of the research. Since this study does not seek to analyze or improve event or subevent detection, the sample need not contain examples of data without any relevant events.
\subsection{Survey of Emergency Management Officials}
Prioritization of subevents requires the ability to make the determination that one subevent is more important than another subevent and should be prioritized higher. This data will come from emergency responders who determine priorities regularly. A survey will be used to seek information from these people. It will also ask respondents to assign priorities to subevents in samples from the datasets acquired previously.
\subsection{Algorithm Comparison Experiments}
In order to compare the algorithms, the data obtained from the survey of emergency management officials will serve two purposes. First, portions of the data will be used as training data for the supervised learning algorithms. Secondly, a different portion of the survey data will be used as true values for evaluating the performance of each selected algorithm. Performance metrics will be calculated for each algorithm and analyzed in order to identify any statistically significant differences in performance.


\section{Literature Review}
In one of the first studies on social media data, \cite{hughes2009twitter} detected specific patterns in Twitter data during mass emergencies. This study was published in 2009. Since then, numerous studies have proposed methods of analyzing social media data in order to provide useful information to emergency responders. In these studies, methods have been proposed for detecting events and subevents as well as making predictions. However, few methods have been proposed for assigning priority to the subevents.
\subsection{Event Detection}
An event can be defined as "An occurrence causing changes in the volume of text data that discusses the associated topic at a specific time. This occurrence is characterized by topic and time, and often associated with entities such as people and location" \cite{dou}. Previous studies have produced methods of detecting events in streams of documents such as news articles. These methods do not work as well with social media streams as the data source due to the large data volumes, high data velocity, and "short, noisy, and unstructured content" \cite{Imran}. As a result, many studies propose methods of detecting events in streaming data.

One approach to event detection involves keyword burst detection. This approach assumes that new events are associated with abrupt increases in keyword frequencies \cite{Imran}. A system to detect earthquakes in Australia and New Zealand  is introduced in \cite{robinson} which works by detecting bursts for the keywords 'earthquak' and '\#eqnz' which are stems of words used to describe earthquakes in the area. Marcus et al. \cite{marcus2011twitinfo} introduced the \textit{TwitInfo} system which accepts keywords from the user and reports events when it detects spikes in the number of tweets containing the provided keywords. This system does not focus on emergency detection but could be configured with keywords to do so.

In \cite{becker2011beyond}, clustering algorithms are used to create groups from incoming tweets. A set of features are computed for each cluster in order to determine which clusters correspond to real-world events. This approach seeks to avoid detection of keyword spikes that are unrelated to an actual event.

Weng and Lee and Corley et al. \cite{Weng} and \cite{Corley} use signal processing approaches for detecting social media events.
\subsection{Subevent Detection}
Events can, in many cases, be divided into refined parts called subevents \cite{Pohl}. These subevents may span multiple locations and require a plan for emergency management. Researchers have proposed methods of identifying subevents in the context of an event. 

In \cite{Khurdiya}, a method for identifying subevents using Conditional Random Fields is proposed. In \cite{Pohl,Hua}, subevent detection methods employing clustering techniques are proposed. Cluster distance is suggested in \cite{Pohl} for finding the most important items (e.g. pictures or videos) within a subevent cluster, but no method is proposed for prioritizing the clusters themselves.

\subsection{Supervised Learning Algorithms}
Previous studies have employed various supervised learning algorithms to classify data retrieved from social media. \textit{ESA} \cite{yin}  uses Na\"{i}ve Bayes and SVM to determine if the data contains information on impacted infrastructure. \textit{EMERSE} \cite{caragea} classifies data according to the type of situation such as medical emergency, people trapped, etc. \textit{AIDR} \cite{Imran2014a} uses random forests to extract data objects that are considered informative. \textit{Tweedr} \cite{ashktorab} uses logistic regression to extract tweets that contain damage or casualty information. Although each of these studies applies a supervised learning algorithm to its respective datasets, none of them use the learning algorithm in order to assign priority to subevents.

\section{Importance/Benefits of the Study}
Research on processing social media data for emergency management should be conducted in order to enable officials to use this data during disaster situations. Emergency responders have expressed interest in taking advantage of social media as a data source in addition to existing data sources, but have been largely unable to do so due to the nature of the data. 

As an example, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which is responsible for managing United Nations disaster response efforts, has shown interest in using social media as a source of disaster information. As investigated in \cite{vieweg2014}, OCHA included Twitter as a source of information when making assessments during Typhoon Yolanda which impacted the Philippines in November of 2013. The tweets obtained were read and labeled by human volunteers. These people were able to process 3,678 tweets; searches performed by \cite{vieweg2014} found 2,302,569 tweets related to the Typhoon Yolanda situation were available at the time of the manual analysis. In interviews regarding twitter data related to Typhoon Yolanda, \cite{vieweg2014} found that OCHA officials felt that twitter data provided little return for the time investment which they felt was too large.

This research will contribute to the goal of providing emergency management agencies, such as OCHA, concise and usable reports from social media sources in a timely manner during emergency situations.

\section{Research Design}
\subsection {Event and Subevent Detection}
The goal of this phase of the research is to be able to obtain results of methods for event and subevent detection found in literature. This study will use one of two approaches for achieving this goal. The first possibility is to locate a data source where results of subevent detection systems can be retrieved. If this is not possible, the second option would be to implement a detection system from previous literature capable of producing the required data.
\subsection{Disaster Dataset Procurement}
From the data source identified in the previous section, a sample of data will be obtained. The sample size will be 50 subevents. If a data source is identified in the previous phase, a simple random sample of events in the data source large enough to yield at least 50 subevents will be chosen. If a detection system was implemented in the previous phase, the "Major Disaster Declarations" in 2016 available from FEMA will be considered the population.\footnote{https://www.fema.gov/disasters/grid/year/2016?field\_disaster\_type\_term\_tid\_1=All} From this population, a simple random sample of events large enough to yield at least 50 subevents will be chosen. Social media data from the selected events will be processed by the system implemented in the previous section in order to obtain the subevents. In the event that the obtainted sample contains more than 50 subevents, a subset of the sample will be randomly selected for the research such that the subset contains exactly 50 subevents.
\subsection{Survey of Emergency Management Officials}
According to the United States Geological Survey, the United States has over 3000 counties or county equivalents (boroughs, parishes, etc.).\footnote{https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9799/2971} A simple random sample of 2000 of these counties will be selected and contacted to seek willingness to participate in a survey. Willing counties will then be sent a survey. A response rate of 20\% would yield a sample of 400 counties or county equivalents.

The surveys will ask participants to assign each of the 50 subevents in the sample a priority on a 5 point scale:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Critical - This subevent requires immediate attention from emergency responders reassigning people and resources if necessary.
	\item High - This subevent requires attention from emergency responders within 1 day
	\item Medium - This subevent requires attention from emergency responders within 1 week
	\item Low - This subevent requires attention from emergency responders but can be addressed outside of a 1 week time frame.
	\item None - This subevent does not require attention from emergency responders.
\end{enumerate}
This scale is arbitrary, but it is used so that respondents all use the same scale for ranking the events. It does not include description such as 'potential loss of life' or 'damage to infrastructure' because this survey seeks to determine how these factors influence prioritization.

The survey will present the subevents grouped by events. The order of the subevents will be randomized within their groups and events will be presented in random order.

This portion of the research will need Institutional Review Board approval because human subjects will be responding to the surveys.
\subsection{Algorithm Comparison Experiments}
A cross-validation approach will be used for comparing the selected algorithms' performance. The subevents will be randomly divided into 5 groups of 10 subevents. From the 5 groups of subevents, 4 groups will be chosen as the training set and 1 group will be chosen as the validation set. Each algorithm will be trained using the subevents from the groups in the training sets and their respective priorities as determined by the survey. Then each algorithm will be used to assign a priority to each subevent in the validation set. Each of these assignments will be correct or incorrect as determined by the survey data, and each algorithm will receive a score from 0 to 10 corresponding to the number of correct classifications. This procedure will be repeated for 4 times such that each group is used once as the validation set.

This process will be repeated 99 times with a new random selection of the 5 groups of subevents each time.

Due to the analysis used for the data obtained by the emergency management survey, it is possible for a subevent to have a decimal value for priority. If one of these values occurs in a training set, the algorithm will be trained with the whole number priorities immediately above and below the actual value. If one of these values occurs in a validation set, the whole number priorities immediately above and below the actual value will both be accepted as correct.

\section{Data Analysis}
There will be no data analysis for the Event and Subevent Detection or Disaster Dataset Procurement. The Survey of Emergency Management Officals and Algorithm Comparison Experiments will both include data analysis.
\subsection{Survey of Emergency Management Officials}
The results of the survey will be used for training and validating the learning algorithms. This will require a single priority value for each subevent. Since the 5 point scale used for rating the priority is an example of ordinal data, the median will be computed for the responses for each subevent. These medians will be used as the true priority of each subevent during training and validation.
\subsection{Algorithm Comparison Experiments}
The experimental design in this study will be a within subject designs. That is multiple treatments will be applied to the same experimental group one at a time. In this case, the experimental group will be a set of data divided into a training set and a validation set. The treatments will be the supervised learning algorithms. The observations will be the scores out of 10 achieved by each algorithm.

A preliminary selection of supervised learning algorithms or treatments includes Conditional Random Fields, Na\"{i}ve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Logistical Regression. These are selected because they have been employed for other applications within the mass emergency social media data domain \cite{yin,caragea,Imran2014a,ashktorab},. This list is subject to change during the course of the research.

Since 100 selections of subevent groups are used and each algorithm receives 5 scores per selection, each algorithm will have distribution of 500 total scores. A series of chi-squared tests will be used to compare algorithms find significant differences in the distributions. Chi-squared tests are appropriate since the independent variable, the algorithm, represents categorical data and the dependent variable, the number of correct classifications, uses a discrete scale. Additional analysis will be required to determine which distribution is superior when chi-squared tests identify statistically significant differences.

\section{Schedule}
The schedule for this project spans 12 months and contains 1 month of flex time to compensate for any parts of the research that take longer than estimated. The schedule is detailed below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Event and Subevent Detection - 1/1 to 1/31  
	\item Dataset Procurement - 2/1 to 3/15  
	\item Survey of Emergency Management Officials - 3/16 to 6/15  
	\item Advanced Research \& Setup of Algorithms - 6/1 to 7/15 
	\item Algorithm Experiments - 7/16 to 9/30 
	\item Data Analysis and Conclusions - 6/16 to 7/15 \& 10/1 to 10/31 
	\item Report Generation - 11/1 to 11/30 
	\item Flex Time - 12/1 to 12/31 
\end{itemize}
The Data Analysis and Conclusions item is scheduled for two time spans. The first of these is for analysis of the results of the survey of emergency management officials. The second is for the analysis of the results of the algorithm experiments.	


\section{Facilities and Special Resources}
Hardware capacity is required for storing datasets. Using Twitter as an example, a single data object occupies around 4KB including metadata \cite{Imran}. One dataset investigated in \cite{vieweg2014} contained millions of data objects. The processing resources need to be powerful enough to run the algorithms for event and subevent detection if necessary as well as the selected supervised learning algorithms in the allotted time.

Implementations of the selected supervised learning algorithms will be required so that they can be evaluated.


\section{Deliverable}
The deliverable of this study will be technical report including a conclusion on the performance of the selected supervised learning algorithms for prioritizing subevents in a mass emergency.

Unincorporated Thoughts
;Does disaster relief use the data already
;*1 Does this imply that tech savvy people will get more aid. what about groups that don't commonly use social media
;Why we don't like top 5 by cluster distance in Pohl
;Define event & subevent
;Definition Section in section I
	supervised learning algo.
;assume detection of event and subevent is given
;Prediction algo approach 
;what criteria for prioritization
do I like the bit about types of disasters in problem description
;External validity maybe the survey
;It is a source not THE source to go with *1
;why we don't need IRB in research design
;Criterion for comparison
list out algos-some citations here
italicize system names
